# Collinear-Points
### Solution for Princeton's Algorithms I assignment
This program takes in a set of points, and then finds all sets of four points which are collinear (have a single line segment which can travel through all four). BruteCollinear.java used a brute-force algorithm for doing this. FastCollinear.java uses a faster, more efficient, algorithm
